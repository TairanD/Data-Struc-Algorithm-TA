## 1 - Amortised Analysis
In the previous chapters, we always estimate the time complexity of an algorithm based on the worst case. However, it is
not always suitable. 

Amortization: 'amortization' comes from accountancy, which is used to spread the cost of sth. expensive over its whole lifetime.
For instance, consider investing in a business where a substantial initial investment is required. It may take several years 
to generate enough profit to recoup the initial investment. Therefore, taking a long-term perspective is crucial ("spreading
the cost of something expensive over its whole lifetime"). In an amortized sense, the cost becomes more manageable over time, 
as profits accrue. This concept of gradual repayment over time helps to make the overall cost acceptable.

Now, let's introduce a new type of balanced BST, which is balanced **in the amortised sense**.
