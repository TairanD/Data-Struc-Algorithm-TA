# Welcome to my DS II Personal TA Supporting Material :smile:

This repository comprises materials related to the specific course, Data Structure & Algorithm II, as taught at
Beijing-Dublin International College, University College Dublin. Within this repository, I aim to share my personal
notes, reflections, and various programs from the course. It is essential to note that these resources are not identical
reproductions of the professor's slides or definitions; instead, they represent my individual comprehension and
insights.

If you have any problem, you can email me (tairan.ding@ucdconnect.ie), or you can directly ask me in the lab. I hope
this repo can help you understand the course better.
