# Welcome to my DS II Personal TA Supporting Material :smile:

This repository comprises materials related to the specific course, _Data Structure & Algorithm II_, as taught at
Beijing-Dublin International College, University College Dublin. Within this repository, I aim to share my personal
notes, reflections, and various programs from the course. It is essential to note that these resources are not identical
reproductions of the professor's slides or definitions; instead, they represent my individual comprehension and
insights. Additionally, I might add some contents I think useful/important.

- [Introduction & Revision](./notes/01-intro.md)
- [Trees & Binary Trees](./notes/02-trees-binary-trees.md)

If you have any problem, you can email me (tairan.ding@ucdconnect.ie), or you can directly ask me in the lab. I hope
this repo can help you understand the course better.
